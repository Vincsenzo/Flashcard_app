- Make flashcards indexable by search engines (dont put them in just the scritp tags)
- Make site indexable by search engines (meta tags, robots.txt, sitemap.xml ...)
- Change stack urls to slugs (and not just id number)
- Put static files (js, css) into the right place (flashdard app folder)
- Create description field for stacks
